        Class.newInstance( ) creates an object of the
        class it is called for, but it can throw exceptions. Here, we create and throw a
        RuntimeException for this programming error, so your code doesnâ€™t have to
        catch such exceptions. You can embed the cause of an error inside a thrown
        exception to pass detailed information about the condition to a client
        programmer. (We cover exceptions in detail in the chapter Error Handling with
        Exceptions.) The benefit of this design is that you can add a new type to the
        system by only adding it to the Class array; the rest of the code takes care of
        itself.
